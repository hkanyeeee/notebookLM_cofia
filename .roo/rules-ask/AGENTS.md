# Project Documentation Rules (Non-Obvious Only)
- "src/" contains VSCode extension code, not source for web apps (counterintuitive)
- Provider examples in app/api/providers/ are the canonical reference (docs are outdated)
- UI runs in VSCode webview with restrictions (no localStorage, limited APIs)
